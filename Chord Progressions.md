(deut. "Kadenz")

An arrangement of chord spacings to be used as pattern. Can be assigned to any key.

Traditionally, there is the I-IV-V progression:
The Tonic (I) is the "home" of the melody. 
	The Subdominant (IV) leads the melody away from the tonic. It makes the melody open to new notes, modulations, etc. Its' base note is the 4th note on the scale of the tonic.
		The Dominant (V) is the chord that leads back to the tonic. It is perfected in a 7th chord. Its' base note is the 5th note on the scale of the tonic.

There are a lot more progressions, like the II-V-I from [[Jazz]].

¹¹ Moreover, by them is your servant warned,
in keeping them there is great reward.
¹² ==Who can discern his errors?
Declare me innocent from **[[Secret Sins (Spurgeon)|hidden faults]]**.==
¹³ Keep back your servant also from presumptuous sins;
==let them not have dominion over me!
Then I shall be blameless,
and innocent of great transgression.
¹⁴ Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart
be acceptable in your sight.==
O LORD, my rock and my redeemer. (ESV)

How must one study the [[Law]] to know the wretchedness of oneself?
How can one experience the cleansing, the 'keeping back' that the [[Holy Spirit]] does?
One must desire God with all their heart. One must strive to be acceptable to God by prayer, by faith, by steadfastness, by meditation of the heart.
But what is Meditation of the heart?

>Meditation:
>focusing the mind of something particular (-> God and his words) in order to achieve mental clarity, emotional calmness, heightened awareness
>practising it leads to relaxation, stress reduction and spiritual growth.

[[Learning verses by heart]] is a condition that has to be met in order to maintain focus on God's word.

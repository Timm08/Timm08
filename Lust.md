## What the [[Bible]] says
When you give in to lust, you dishonour yourself and [[God]].
You create a distance between yourself and God.
You defile yourself and sin not against others except the God who made you, but against yourself.

Lust already happens in your heart as soon as you look at a person with lustful intent. It is the exact same moral burden as actually sleeping with someone's spouse, it is adultery, says Jesus in Mt 5:28.

The [[Bible]] calls for you to live in holiness and honour (1 Thessalonians 4:3-8)
and states that a believer who walks in the [[Holy Spirit]] is ought to "know how to control his own body in holiness and honour" (4:4).

By immersing into sexual immorality you disregard not just a [[Law|law]], but God who gave you the Spirit (4:8) and **created you not to use your organs for your own sake, but His.**

The only way to escape lust is keeping in step with the Spirit (Galatians 5:25).

## What are the physical consequences of practising sexual immorality?

Observing yourself, you feel at first, **regret**.
After this dopamine spike, the baseline drops to a level proportionally lower to before to the high you chased.

Small high -> Little decrease of baseline dopamine value
Big high -> Big decrease of baseline dopamine value

This baseline will stay like this for quite some time and can be raised with disciplining activities.

**Another big factor is whether or not pornography was consumed or not.**

It makes you associate pleasure with **a picture**, not a relationship.
Over time, it will recondition your brain to think this way.

# DO NOT COMMIT TO THIS

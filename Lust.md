## What the [[Bible]] says
When you give in to lust, you dishonour yourself and [[God]].
You create a distance between yourself and God.
You defile yourself and sin not against others except the God who made you, but against yourself.

The [[Bible]] calls for you to live in holiness and honour (1 Thessalonians 4:3-8)
and states that a believer who walks in the [[Holy Spirit]] is ought to "know how to control his own body in holiness and honour" (4:4).

By immersing into sexual immorality you disregard not just a [[Law|law]], but God who gave you the Spirit (4:8) and **created you not to use your organs for your own sake, but His.**

A way to escape Lust is meditating on God's word. Focusing on what God says. Keeping in step with the Spirit (Galatians 5:25).

## What are the physical consequences of practising sexual immorality?

Observing yourself, you feel at first, **regret**.
After this dopamine spike, the baseline drops to a level proportionally lower to before to the high you chased.

Small high -> Little decrease of baseline dopamine value
Big high -> Big decrease of baseline dopamine value

This baseline will stay like this for quite some time and can be raised with disciplining activities.

**Another big factor is whether or not pornography was consumed or not.**

It makes you associate pleasure with **a picture**, not a relationship.
Over time, it will recondition your brain to think this way.

# DO NOT COMMIT TO THIS

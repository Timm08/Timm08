[[God]] is protecting his children from danger, if it is his will.
He is omnipotent and sovereign, and He is the only one we can rely on.
So it is of no use to worry and fear what happens to us in this wretched world.

### Fear of the Lord / fear in honour

The only fear that Christians should always, necessarily have, is the Fear of God.
If you don't fear God, you don't care about dishonouring him nor care about being near Him.
It is absolutely vital for our life to have a mature fear of God. 
That is, to fear him in order not to dishonour Him, but to draw near to him to stay in relationship.

[[God]] is protecting his children from danger, if it is his will.
He is omnipotent and sovereign, and He is the only one we can rely on.
So it is of no use to worry and fear what happens to us in this wretched world.

Rather, [[Sin|sin]] is the thing we should keep out of our hearts, since it would grieve the [[Holy Spirit]]and we would practically run from God.
It is the utmost important to look after what is in heaven and immaterial and not after what can be stolen by thieves and be eaten by moths, says [[Jesus]].

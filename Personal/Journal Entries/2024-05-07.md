#betterdays
I was inspired by:

- the Bible verses I have read. (Isaiah 43, 1 Thessalonians 4:4-8)
- my emotions
- in particular the emotions I felt towards my love and the music I listened to
- evident acts of the Holy Spirit in my thought process (which is incredibly relieving)

I am grateful for:

- being forgiven for my immorality
- having found refuge in the Lord
- being calmed
- having read what i have read
- having such beautiful people around who share all these things with me
- being momentarily comfortable with my thoughts
- regaining mental clarity to some degree
- having done my daily work
- having my needs fulfilled by the Lord
- feeling true love

I am truly shaken to my bones for [[God]]â€˜s mercy and might.
Glory to Him forever.

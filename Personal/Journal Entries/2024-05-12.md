I want to get baptised because I have Jesus as my king and saviour. Not because I am so good and cool and want to show that to everyone. I need not to be afraid of what the others might think of me. I only need to fear [[God]] and love others. I hope that the transition to youth ministry will be seamless and that the others who go with me will come regularly.

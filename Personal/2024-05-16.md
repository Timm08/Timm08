I have no control over my heart and therefore over the flesh. I gave up on fighting the desires that I cannot satisfy without separation from God.

But:
I am grateful for the trip I can go on tomorrow.
I am grateful for the friends I have in Christ and in the world.
I am grateful for the signs of the Holy Spirit.
I am grateful for the great food.
I am grateful for the now better relationship with my parents.
I am grateful for God's grace that is without bounds. I can't even fathom it myself.

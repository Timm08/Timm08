Daily focused practise makes us more virtuous at the practised subject.
A precondition to successfully practise **daily** and **focused** is [[deliberation]].
Not practising only when the motivation is there, but even when it doesn't seem to be possible on the day.

How then is it possible to focus on the subject when one forces himself to practise even though he doesn't want to? Well, [[Purpose]], because if taking something like deliberation or even pain upon oneself without a reason, the human nature will not comply as seen in the most vigorous part of US Navy SEAL Training, "Hell Week".

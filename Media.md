Distracting Media is *dangerous*. It takes time and energy away from me and effectively wastes it to empty information consume or nonchalant small talk.

#### Examples

Distracting apps include especially short-form-content-platforms like YouTube or TikTok, but also Social Media in general, like Discord. 

WhatsApp has a special exception, as it's more personal and uses my number which is to be kept private for close, real, persons.

#### So how do you avoid getting [[Distraction|distracted]]?

There are two approaches: 
1. The theological/biblical and
2. The scientific.

##### 1. The biblical approach
Of course, there is [[Matthew]] 6:33-34:

>  But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you. Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient is the day for its own trouble.

"These" referring to food and clothes. 
Most importantly however is, that seeking money, clothes and further earthly things are said to put after distracting yourself and worrying about them. 

##### 2. The scientific approach

There are a lot of ways to limit distraction, but to eliminate it, I need to develop my own [[Workflow]] and try out different things. General tips though are:

- breaking up study sessions over smaller, but frequent time periods (-> [[Pomodoro Timer]])
- [[Headphones]] (yes its that easy)
- removing unnecessary items from where I study
- **putting my phone somewhere I can't hear or see it and not using it for the entire session including breaks**
- [[Studying]] frequently (I should start)
- Yerba Mate/Coffee/Matcha

This is a skill acquired through [[daily practise]]. It means getting the gist of a text, extracting its frames, patterns, claims, conditions, etc. 

In order to do that, various [[thinking tools]] are needed. Again, these are best if developed by yourself, because they are then automatically used to their best extent. Also, developing these tools is done by [[daily practise]].

Insight is generated if something left unconsidered before changes the way something is viewed. 
It often makes sense to ask the question of "*What is not meant? What is excluded on purpose?*" because it trains to look at other descriptions of the idea. That is a sort of hot spot where insight lies.

The most important way to keep the insight on long terms is to take notes.
Writing is essentially thinking on display.
It confronts us with our own understanding and if that understanding is sufficient or not. Which is obviously what the [[mere-exposure effect]] teaches us.

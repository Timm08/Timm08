Purpose // Fleeting note
With a purpose, you engage in tasks that seem boring with more [[Passion]], because you need to achieve a goal.

### Purpose in class
If you attend lectures with the first [[Priorities|priority]] of [[writing]], you listen more intently and focus efficiently on the things that are the most important. No matter the boringness, you will have the attention to look for interesting ideas to capture and get a view on the current state of research.

### Purpose of life
This is a highly personal matter. In my case, the purpose in life is to live a life that is pleasant to [[God]], that praises God. Living in a worshipping relationship with God is all it should take for me to move forward with ease. Of course, it goes against my nature and I frequently veer off and serve other purposes. In that case, I need to repent and go back to the narrow path.

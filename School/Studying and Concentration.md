How do I stay focused in school? 
How do I ace exams?
How do I gain a broad range of knowledge?

I know what it takes, vaguely.
There are many different ways to study. For a subject like Geology, I mostly use **[[Blurting]]**.
It's when you revise a piece of information, and write everything you remember onto a blank sheet and then look after what is missing. Rinse and repeat.

For vocabulary or keywords, I have heard that the best way is [[Active Recall]]. But I don't really know what that is yet.
